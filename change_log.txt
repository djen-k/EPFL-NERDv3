18/05/2020 - Strain detection: fixed problem of different strain values between first and subsequent calls do dea_fit_ellipse which caused the strain reference to be wrong.
18/05/2020 - Setup Dialog: no longer crashes if more than 6 cameras exist
18/05/2020 - Strain detection: Made sure that the image averaging routine checks for outliers so it doesn't get messed up by glitched images
18/05/2020 - Setup Dialog: Settings are saved even if dialog is closed without starting a test
18/05/2020 - Setup Dialog: Take new image and record strain reference buttons now disable while busy, prefenting impatient clicks
18/05/2020 - Switchboard: Made min voltage a Switchboard property. Changed set_voltage_no_overshoot to only activate when above the min voltage. Increased threshold and timeout when waiting for voltage to reach the set point to avoid false positives in fault detection.
23/05/2020 - Setup Dialog: Added field for wait time before measurement in AC mode
23/05/2020 - Main: implemented use of stored wait time before measurement in AC mode
23/05/2020 - Setup Dialog: fixed bug that causes error when loading strain reference from previous test with a full set of 6 DEAs
23/05/2020 - Main/Data saver: record total number of cycles
23/05/2020 - Main: Fixed bugs: AC frequency not getting set correctly; high phase transitioning immediatly back to low
24/05/2020 - Switchboard: Fixed timeout, which was set to 0 (no reconnection attempts) by default instead of -1 (infinite reconnection attempts)
24/05/2020 - Main: Fixed maximum number of cycles (for AC mode), which was set to 65535 (max int16) and which causes the switchboard to never stop cycling because the current cycle number overflows so it's never larger than 65535. Now set to 65000 to give it enough margin.
25/05/2020 - Keithley: Added reconnect function so the instrument automatically reconnects and software doesn't crash if connection is lost at any point
25/05/2020 - hvps: Fixed bug when reading cycle number that causes a crash if reading is invalid
25/05/2020 - Image Capture: fixed reconnection which didn't trigger if images are only grabbed but not retrieved. Now, reconnection triggers if any grab fails (but only when grabbing a set with 'grab_images', not for a single grab).
25/05/2020 - Main: set HVPS parameters on every cycle to make sure we get back on track if the HVPS resets
25/05/2020 - Main: Make sure relays get reconnected in auto mode after HVPS resets
26/05/2020 - Switchboard: Fixed the set voltage wait until reached method so it waits while the switchboard is testing for shorts
26/05/2020 - Main: Keep track of completed cycles properly and make sure all requested cycles (and not more) are completed even in case of a reset/disconnect
26/05/2020 - Main: Change the wait high before measurement phase so it still actvely monitors the DEAs in that time
27/05/2020 - Switchboard: Continuous reading now also records voltage set point, relay state, and switching mode (in addition to voltage and time)
27/05/2020 - Switchboard: Data from continuous reading can be saved to separate output file
28/05/2020 - Switchboard: Made all communications with hardware (write + read) atomic (using com port lock) to make sure we don't end up reading the wrong response when continuous reading thread is running
28/05/2020 - Main: Added short 1s pause at SwMode 0 when switching from AC to DC. This prevents the samples from getting exposed to the voltage spike that occurs due to the drop in current draw.
02/06/2020 - Main: pass electrical state only for active DEAs to strain visualization method so it shows the correct state for each DEA and doesn't mix them up
03/06/2020 - Switchboard: when increasing voltage stepwise, start increasing from previous voltage, not from 0
03/06/2020 - Main: fixed error in calculation of time at max V
03/06/2020 - Main: fixed bug which caused the switchobard to be set to AC mode during wait low phase (didn't really matter much but looked confusing in the graphs)
03/06/2020 - Main: set reduced PID gains before starting an experiment to reduce the chance of voltage spikes
03/06/2020 - Setup Dialog: camera selection box and Adjust button are above the image now so they are less likely to disappear off the bottom edge of the screen
